        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            Gujarati Kadhi is a traditional Gujarati preparation of a wonderful
            sweet and spicy curd mixture thickened with besan (gram flour). It's
            a very popular Gujarati dish made from buttermilk or dahi (yogurt)
            and gram flour. This easy variant of kadhi is made without gram
            flour fritters (pakoda). It makes for a quick comforting lunch or
            dinner paired with a side of steamed basmati rice or roti.
        </p>
        <p>
            The dish gets its name “Kadhi” as it is a yogurt-based gravy dish to
            which gram flour (besan) is added, tempered and then simmered with
            spices. The addition of gram flour helps to thicken and also
            prevents the curd from separating or splitting while cooking. It
            also adds a creamy consistency.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gujaratis like their kadhi usually slightly sweet and spicy. The
            combination of spices used for tempering is different than Pakoray
            wali Kadhi and Rajasthani Kadhi. We do not add fritters (Pakora) to
            our kadhi. Instead, we make it sweet and spicy by adding jaggery,
            green chili, and ginger.
