        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            Carrot Halwa, also known as Gajar ka Halwa or “Gajrela”, is a
            traditional North Indian dessert. It's made by simmering fresh
            grated carrots with full fat milk, sugar, and ghee. This delicious
            dessert is delicately scented with cardamom powder and garnished
            with chopped nuts.
        </p>
        <p>
            The dish gets its name “Gajar Halwa” since carrots are known as
            “Gajar” in Hindi and Halwa is a pudding-like dessert from the Indian
            Sub-Continent. So Gajar Halwa is essentially an Indian carrot
            pudding. However, it's not the pudding you are probably thinking
            of! This neither has an egg nor a thickening agent/ingredient.

            The dish can be served in many different ways. One common
            presentation is the “molded bowl” method, where cooks mash a portion
            of the food into a container, then turn it upside down so that the
            food on the plate has a neat, consistent shape. Other dishes are
            presented at the bottom of a serving bowl, with various colorful
            garnishes. Some cooks arrange small garnishes in star shapes or
            other patterns on the surface of the carrot halwa.
