      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the onion and
          garlic in the hot oil until the onions are soft and golden brown,
          about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sprinkle the cumin, coriander, turmeric, and chili powder over the
          onion and garlic.
        </li>
        <li>
          Continue cooking until the seasonings are fragrant, about 30 seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour the pureed tomatoes into the skillet; cook until the excess
          liquid evaporates and the oil separates, 3 to 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the paneer, water, sugar, and salt to the mixture; stir gently so
          the paneer does not break apart.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook until the paneer begins to absorb some of the liquid, about 10
          minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Stir the cream into the mixture and simmer another 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Garnish with cilantro to serve.</li>
      </ol>
